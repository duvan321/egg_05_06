- 🙎‍♂️Here I tell you a little about how I did it :

- Create 4 html files including 3 to link to the main page,
  In each html file I used a "header" tag where with the width
  tags I called the html files.\_
- In the file of the main page I used "main" tags for the presentation
  and the footer for the videos and a button in the footer where clicking
  on it leaves a message that says "At the bottom of the page I worked these
  buttons with javascript and a sweetalert library for the alerts, so I did
  with each html file with the buttons.
  For the styles I worked with css where I shaped the page.._
  -In the services file I simply used ul tags for a list of information
  about the services, with javascript I created a function to display messages
  every time I clicked on an icon I added with the font-awesome library._
- In the contact file we create a form where the user enters his data and when
  he clicks the send button he gets
  a message saying "form sent successfully" all this thanks to javascript.
- In the about file, simply with a small text that shows more about the company
  and also some added images.
- Thanks to css we gave styles to the page to make it look more presentable.
  Something that I wanted to emphasize is that on the main page there is a
  welcome alert where the user is asked for the place where they are from.
  I hope you like my page, little by little, that you learn more about this
  great path of hiring programming, improving my page
  a little more and creating others.
